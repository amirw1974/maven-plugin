White Source Update Plugin: Usage

* Updating your White Source projects

  The goals for the Compiler Plugin are bound to their respective phases in the
  build lifecycle.  So to compile your sources, you need only to tell maven
  until which lifecycle to execute.  The following will compile your sources:

+-----
mvn whitesource:update
+-----

  The above command will execute both <<<compiler:compile>>> and
  <<<compiler:test-compile>>> since the compile phase happens a few phases
  before the test-compile phase.

* Configuring Your Compiler Plugin

  Since the Compiler Plugin executes automatically during their phases, you
  don't have to put <<<executions>>> unlike the other plugins.
